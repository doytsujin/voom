VOOM!
=====

It goes VOOM!

    Then the Voom...
    It went VOOM!
    And, oh boy!  What a VOOM!

    Now, don't ask me what Voom is.
    I never shall know
    But, boy! Let me tell you
    It does clean up snow!

    -- _The Cat in the Hat Comes Back_, by Dr. Seuss

VOOM is some VMWare / vCenter lab management software I wrote to
help me keep track of legitimate uses of a shared, communal lab
environment (focused heavily on BOSH), and mete out swift VM
termination to rogue machines as discovered.
